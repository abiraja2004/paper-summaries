title: Human Level Concept Learning
---

Let's first start with a first pass of the paper. Broadly, here's a rundown of the paper:
 
- Motivation: Humans learn from few examples, and can reuse learned concepts for diverse tasks. New ML algorithms find that hard. 
- Approach: Present a ML framework which is inspired by 3 ideas in cognitive science - 1) compositionality, 2) causality, and 3) learning to learn.
- Assumptions: 
- Contributions: A new framework which has causality built in, and learns compositionally. A new dataset (omniglot), which is like a transpose of the MNIST (few samples of many classes). 
- Applications:
